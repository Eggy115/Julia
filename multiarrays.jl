# repeat can be useful to expand a grid

# Array reductions
# many functions in Julia have an array method
# to be applied to specific dimensions of an array:

sum(m4, dims=3)		# takes the sum over the third dimension
sum(m4, dims=(1,3))	# sum over first and third dim

maximum(m4, dims=2)	# find the max elt along dim 2
findmax(m4, dims=3)	# find the max elt and its index along dim 3
					# (available only in very recent Julia versions)

# Broadcasting
# when you combine arrays of different sizes in an operation,
# an attempt is made to "spread" or "broadcast" the smaller array
# so that the sizes match up. broadcast operators are preceded by a dot:

m4 .+ 3		# add 3 to all elements
m4 .+ [1,2]		# adds vector [1,2] to all elements along first dim

# slices and views
m4=m4[:,:,1]	# holds dim 3 fixed
m4[:,2,:]	# that's a 2x1x2 array. not very intuititive to look at

# get rid of dimensions with size 1:
dropdims(m4[:,2,:], dims=2)	# that's better

# assign new values to a certain view
m4[:,:,1] = rand(1:6,2,3)
printsum(m4)
#> 2×3 Array{Int64,2}: [3 5 3; 1 3 5]

# (for more examples of try, catch see Error Handling above)
try
	# this will cause an error, you have to assign the correct type
	m4[:,:,1] = rand(2,3)
catch err
	println(err)
end
#> InexactError(:Int64, Int64, 0.7603891754678744)

try
	# this will cause an error, you have to assign the right shape
	m4[:,:,1] = rand(1:6,3,2)
catch err
	println(err)
